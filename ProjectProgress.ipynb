    "This project aims to observe traffic dynamics within six fictional futuristic cities, leveraging a dataset comprising over 1.2 million records. Each record encapsulates a variety of factors that influence traffic conditions, such as vehicle types (including flying cars), weather and economic conditions, the day of the week, and specific hours of the day, among others. By analyzing these factors, we intend to uncover underlying patterns and insights into how different variables impact traffic flow and energy consumption. Our approach will involve analyzing the impact of factors like weather, economic conditions, and vehicle types on traffic flow and energy consumption.\n",

    "    - The dataset originates from a simulated study designed to reflect the complexity of traffic management in futuristic urban settings. It covers diverse aspects of urban mobility, including variations in vehicle types (e.g., cars, flying cars), weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy), economic states (e.g., booming, recession), and traffic-related variables (e.g., speed, energy consumption). The broad range of data will allow us to explore the multifaceted nature of urban traffic dynamics.\n",
