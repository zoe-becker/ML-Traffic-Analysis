# SUBMISSION FORMAT FOR THE REPORTS

#  <Title>
**<All Authors>** 

## Project Summary

<Complete for *Project Proposal* assignment submission to give idea to the reader what youa re trying to do and how> 

<Fully rewrite the summary as the last step for the *Project Submission* assignment: github.com repositories on how people shortblurb thre project. It is a standalone section. It is written to give the reader a summary of your work. Be sure to specific, yet brief.>


## Problem Statement 

<Add one sentence for the *Project Proposal* assignment submission that captures the project statement.>

<Expand the section with few sentences for the *Project Progress* assignment submission> 
* Give a clear and complete statement of the problem.
* What is the benchmark you are using.  Why?  
* Where does the data come from, what are its characteristics? Include informal success measures (e.g. accuracy on cross-validated data, without specifying ROC or precision/recall etc) that you planned to use. 
* What do you hope to achieve?>

<Finalize for the *Project Submission* assignment submission> 

## Dataset 

<Add highlights on the dataset, specifically the size in instances and attributes for **Project Proposal**>

<Complete the following for the **Project Progress**>
* Description of the dataset (dimensions, names of variables with their description) If in doubt, use 3.1-3.3. [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) as a guideline.  
* If you are using benchmarks, describe the data in details. If you are collecting data, describe why, how, data format, volume, labeling, etc.>

<Expand and complete for *Project Submission*>

* What Processing Tools have you used.  Why?  Add final images from jupyter notebook. Use questions from 3.4 of the [Datasheets For Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) paper for a guide.>  

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

<Complete for **Project Progress**>
* What EDA graphs you are planning to use? 
* Why? - Add figures if any

<Expand and complete for the **Project Submission**>
* Describe the methods you explored (usually algorithms, or data wrangling approaches). 
  * Include images. 
* Justify methods for feature normalization selection and the modeling approach you are planning to use. 

## Data Preprocessing 

<Complete for *Project Progress*>
* Have you considered Dimensionality Reduction or Scaling? 
  * If yes, include steps here.  
* What did you consider but *not* use? Why?

## Machine Learning Approaches

<Complete for **Project Progress**>

* What is your baseline evaluation setup? Why? 
* Describe the ML methods that you consider using and what is the reason for their choice? 
   * What is the family of machine learning algorithms you are using and why?

<Expand and complete for **Project Submission**>

* Describe the methods/datasets (you can have unscaled, selected, scaled version, multiple data farmes) that you ended up using for modeling. 

* Justify the selection of machine learning tools you have used
  * How they informed the next steps? 
* Make sure to include at least twp models: (1) baseline model, and (2) improvement model(s).  
   * The baseline model  is typically the simplest model that's applicable to that data problem, something we have learned in the class. 
   * Improvement model(s) are available on Kaggle challenge site, and you can research github.com and papers with code for approaches.  

## Experiments 

< **Project Progress** should include experiments you have completed thus far.>

<**Project Submission** should only contain final version of the experiments. Please use visualizations whenever possible.>
* Describe how did you evaluate your solution 
  * What evaluation metrics did you use? 
* Describe a baseline model. 
  * How much did your model outperform the baseline?  
* Were there other models evaluated on the same dataset(s)? 
  * How did your model do in comparison to theirs? 
  * Show graphs/tables with results 
  * Present error analysis and suggestions for future improvement. 

## Conclusion
<Complete for the **Project Submission**>
* What did not work? 
* What do you think why? 
* What were approaches, tuning model parameters you have tried? 
* What features worked well and what didn't? 
* When describing methods that didn't work, make clear how they failed and any evaluation metrics you used to decide so. 
* How was that a data-driven decision? Be consise, all details can be left in .ipynb
